**CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program**

**1. What is the title of your program?**

    German Traffic Sign Classifier for Self-Driving Cars

**2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?**

    This program will help improve the safety and reliability of self-driving cars by accurately classifying German traffic signs. Reliable traffic sign recognition is crucial for autonomous vehicles to navigate roads safely and adhere to traffic regulations.

**3. What will you learn from developing this program?**

    I will learn how to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification, with a specific focus on pre-processing techniques for image datasets. This includes understanding various image augmentation methods, normalization, and how these pre-processing steps impact the performance of the CNN. Additionally, I will gain experience in testing and validating these pre-processing functions to ensure they work correctly.

**4. What Python modules will your program use?**

    - `os`
    - `numpy`
    - `pandas`
    - `opencv`
    - `scikit-learn`
    - `tensorflow`
    - `keras`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `pytest`
    - `seaborn`

**5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each perform a single task?**

    Yes, the program will be modular, with functions that perform specific tasks such as loading the dataset, pre-processing images, building the CNN model, training the model, and evaluating its performance. These functions will have parameters and return results to facilitate testing and reuse.

**6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program functions?**

    Yes, I will write test functions to validate the functionality of at least two critical functions in the program. Specifically, I will test:
    - The image pre-processing function to ensure it correctly applies augmentations and normalization.
    - The data loading function to confirm it accurately reads and processes the dataset into the expected format for model training.

**7. More Context**

    I already have lots of experience building models like this and it is not going to be difficult.
